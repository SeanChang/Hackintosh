## Note

+   Official hardware support for macOS 10.15 "Catalina" is modestly more limited than it is for macOS 10.14 "Mojave" that came before it. It also drops support for 32-bit apps entirely. Be certain to verify hardware and app compatibility before upgrading an older Hackintosh to this version of the operating system or buying parts for a new system.
