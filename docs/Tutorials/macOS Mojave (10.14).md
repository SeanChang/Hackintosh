## Note

+   official hardware support for macOS 10.14 "Mojave" is more limited than it is for macOS 10.13 "High Sierra" that preceded it. Be particularly certain to verify hardware and app compatibility before upgrading an older Hackintosh to this version of the operating system or buying parts for a new one.
