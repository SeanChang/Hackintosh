## Background

However, it's a pity that until Hackintosh is about to fade away, there hasn't been a set of tutorials suitable for beginners to learn in Internet. So i took the time to write this series of Hackintosh tutorials from scratch. While helping others, it can also prove that I have been in the field of Hackintosh.

Actually, [the OpenCore official documentation](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)is already very good. Most of the content of this tutorial will also be borrowed from the OpenCore official documentation. The original files of this tutorial have also been open - sourced, and the project address is:[https://github.com/SeanChang/Hackintosh](https://github.com/SeanChang/Hackintosh)
