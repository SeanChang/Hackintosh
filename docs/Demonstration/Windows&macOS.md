Drive C will be used as the C drive for Windows in the future, and 123GB is usually sufficient for daily light - use.

Drive D will be used to install macOS at that time, and 353GB is actually sufficient for daily use.

Drive E is a partition created temporarily. Actually, it is the ESP boot partition (the partition must be > 200MB). The boot files of both Windows and macOS in the future will be placed here.

## macOS Single - system

If it is a single - system of macOS, actually there is no need to enter PE for disk partitioning. When installing the system, just select the entire disk directly.
