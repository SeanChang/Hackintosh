This part mainly introduces information related to machine models. Tools like OCC can be used to generate it with one click. Just choose the one similar to your CPU. Since Intel CPUs are rather complex, if you are not sure, you can search on the official website to ensure that they are of the same architecture. This is the most efficient and simplest way. Or you can also refer to the [OC official SMBIOS selection](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/smbios-support.html) for suggestions.

OCC will automatically change the CPU model according to the machine model you choose. If you find that your CPU model is incorrect, you can manually change the ProcessorType to 0.

## AMD and CPU settings without integrated graphics

Generally, if your CPU does not have an integrated graphics (ending with F) or your CPU's integrated graphics has no solution (AMD series), it is recommended that the best machine model to set is **iMac Pro1,1**.

Because the Mac model in this area also does not have an integrated graphics card, you can fully utilize the discrete graphics card for hardware decoding:

## Is your serial number perfect?

Since the serial number will affect the use of iMessage (text messages), if you want a closer experience to a genuine Apple product, you have to choose a valid serial number. The official Apple serial number query address is:

There are 3 levels of serial numbers.

**Valid and unused serial numbers > Invalid serial numbers > Valid but used serial numbers**

I tested that the **invalid serial numbers automatically generated by the editor do not affect the use of Apple services**. Therefore, I suggest that if you can't get a perfect valid and unused serial number, just use an invalid serial number directly. As time goes by, the number of valid and unused serial numbers will only become fewer and fewer.

### Invalid serial numbers

### Valid but used serial numbers

Next are valid serial numbers that have been used. Maybe the telephone technical support has expired:

**Used and the telephone support has expired**

Or maybe the telephone technical support is still valid:

**Used but the telephone support is still valid**

But it doesn't help much. This means that this serial number has also been used.

### Valid and unused serial numbers

The most perfect serial number. I tried for a very long time and finally got one:

![](https://seanchang.github.io/picx-images-hosting/20241109/xuanyuan.me-1626259524646.webp)

This means that the serial number exists and has not been activated yet. When you see this kind of serial number, don't hesitate and go for it!

However, for some older models, basically you can't get this kind of serial number anymore. They have been discontinued for a long time. So to get this kind of serial number, you need both luck and opportunity.
