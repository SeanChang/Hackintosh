## Basic knowledge

Basic knowledge assumes that everyone understands by default. If you don't, it is recommended to review the basics before reading this tutorial.

## Time, Stability, Copyright

If you have a project with a deadline, please don't start reading this tutorial, because the process of starting with Hackintosh usually won't be smooth sailing. Even a small detour can be extremely time - consuming. Also, pay attention to rest. The process of Hackintosh doesn't require you to stay up all night.

If you require a stable system, try not to use Hackintosh as much as possible. Although the perfection of Hackintosh is infinitely close to that of a genuine Mac, there is still the word "Hack" after all. When installing, make sure to back up important data.

If your company is one that popularizes genuine software (usually large companies like BAT), don't use Hackintosh to connect to the company's network. Otherwise, you may receive a lawyer's letter from Apple (a tall tree catches the wind). Strictly speaking, Hackintosh belongs to hacking behavior and infringes on Apple's copyright.

## Preparation Work

A computer that meets the [hardware limitations of Hackintosh](../1 - 2/) and a USB flash drive of at least 16GB. Although 16GB seems to be completely sufficient currently, the size of Apple's mirror images has been increasing in recent years. I once got a prompt of insufficient USB flash drive space when burning a 3 - partition mirror image.

In addition, the faster the USB flash drive, the better. It can greatly shorten the time for making the Hackintosh installation USB flash drive and system installation.

## Basic Operations

First, before installing Hackintosh, make sure that you can proficiently install the Windows or Linux system (a plus). Because Hackintosh installation requires the disk to meet certain requirements, it is common to delete partitions and reinstall the system. If you don't know how to install Windows or proficiently use the PE system, it is recommended to learn these basic skills before learning Hackintosh installation.
